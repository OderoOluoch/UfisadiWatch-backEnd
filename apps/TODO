Notes
wait for db
- when using postgres on django and docker -> sometimes, the app starts before the postgres server is available
 container may ahve started but initializing somethings & setting drivers in the behind the scence. So its not ready
 for Djngo to connect hence when Django tries to conncet, it crashes. Work aroun is to add the "wait for db command"
- wait makes dB available before Django can connce to it

[] Add wait for Db - > core -> management -> commands-> wait_for_db.py 

[] Serialize bid & vendor models
[] Forms for company & user profile
